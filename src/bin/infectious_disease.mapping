P09958|(Microbial infection) Facilitates human coronaviruses EMC and SARS-CoV-2 infections by proteolytically cleaving the spike protein at the monobasic S1/S2 cleavage site. This cleavage is essential for spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and entry into human lung cells|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100096|COVID-19
O15393|(Microbial infection) Facilitates human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections via two independent mechanisms, proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 receptor which promotes viral uptake, and cleavage of coronavirus spike glycoproteins which activates the glycoprotein for host cell entry (PubMed:24227843, PubMed:32142651). Proteolytically cleaves and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) and the fusion glycoproteins F0 of Sendai virus (SeV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4a and 4b viruses (HPIV). Essential for spread and pathogenesis of influenza A virus (strains H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9); involved in proteolytic cleavage and activation of hemagglutinin (HA) protein which is essential for viral infectivity|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100096|COVID-19
P07711|(Microbial infection) Facilitates human coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections via proteolysis of coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins in lysosome for entry into host cell (PubMed:32142651, PubMed:32221306, PubMed:16339146, PubMed:18562523). Proteolysis within lysosomes is sufficient to activate membrane fusion by coronaviruses SARS-CoV and EMC (HCoV-EMC) S as well as Zaire ebolavirus glycoproteins (PubMed:16081529, PubMed:26953343, PubMed:18562523)|http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100096|COVID-19
